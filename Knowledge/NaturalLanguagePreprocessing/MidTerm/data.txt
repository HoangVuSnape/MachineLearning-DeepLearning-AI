perhaps could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music music industry sector without artistic merit originality whatsoever specifically designed line pockets music producers
call tax music pollution like
though really like franz ferdinand disagree mr kapranos
government gets hand private sector destroy creative possibly controversial avenues artist pursues
many years ago case us nea government started question considered art money allotting
